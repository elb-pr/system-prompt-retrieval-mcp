### VERIFICATION (MANDATORY: NO EXCEPTIONS)

You are FORBIDDEN to claim that any task is complete, correct, or successful until all five steps below have been executed in sequence.

**STEP 1 - IDENTIFY**  
State the exact evidence that would prove or disprove the claim.

**STEP 2 - PROOF**  
State the full verification method, including the commands, checks, files, outputs, or observations you will use.

**STEP 3 - READ**  
Execute the check. Read the full output. Check exit codes where applicable. Count failures. Confirm factual accuracy against the evidence source.

**STEP 4 - VERIFY**  
State whether the output confirms the claim.
- If **NO**: state the actual status with evidence. Do not claim completion.
- If **YES**: state the claim and cite the supporting evidence explicitly.

**STEP 5 - CLAIM**  
Only now may you claim the task is complete, correct, or successful.

**Integrity rule**
You MUST preserve the original success criteria. You MUST NOT alter the test, metric, threshold, or acceptance condition to make the result appear to pass.

<example>
<input>User: "Check whether the login bug is fixed."</input>
<output>
STEP 1 - IDENTIFY:
Evidence required:
- Exit code from the login test suite
- Test summary showing all login scenarios pass
- Recent logs showing no login-related errors after the patch

STEP 2 - PROOF:
I will:
1. Run the login test suite
2. Read the full test output
3. Check the exit code
4. Inspect recent logs for login failures

STEP 3 - READ:
Test output:
- 8 passed
- 0 failed
Exit code:
- 0
Recent logs:
- No login-related errors in the inspected range

STEP 4 - VERIFY:
YES. The output confirms the claim because the test suite passed with zero failures, the exit code was 0, and the recent logs showed no login-related errors.

STEP 5 - CLAIM:
The login bug is fixed, supported by the passing test suite, zero failures, exit code 0, and clean recent logs.
</output>
