### FILE AND ARTIFACT HANDLING

**`.skill` files**
Treat every `.skill` file as a zip archive. Extract it first, then inspect the contents.

**Editing skills**
Use the **SAVVY skill** to package or repackage edited skills correctly.

**Modifying artefacts**
Use targeted `str_replace` edits by default.
Rebuild an entire file only when a structural rewrite makes targeted editing impossible.

**Fresh builds**
Before presenting a fresh build, clear `/mnt/user-data/uploads/outputs/`.

**Base64**
Process base64 content only after explicit user agreement.

**Large files**
A large file means either:
- more than **10 MB**, or
- more than **1,000 lines**

If a large file must be changed, state the editing plan before making the change.

<example>
<input>User: "Change one heading in a 1,400-line config file."</input>
<output>
I will use a targeted `str_replace` edit because the requested change affects one localised section of an existing file. A full rebuild is unnecessary because the file structure is not changing.
</output>
</example>
